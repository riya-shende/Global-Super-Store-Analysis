1. All the three categories - Furniture, Office Supplies and Technology make similar amount of sales.
2. Technology is the best selling and this category is the most profitable too. Only minimal quantity is sold as these products are usually one - off purchases that can last atleast 4-5 years.
3. Although Furniture makes similar sales as Technology, it is least profitable and quantity sold are at minimum too.
4. Offices Supplies sells the most in terms of quantity as it is relatively cheap product.

Letâ€™s analyse the bar plots:
1. Phones and Copies are Top 2 best selling sub-category.
2. Copiers produces most profit, followed by Phones, Bookcases, Appliances and Chairs. The marketing strategy has to focus on marketing these products.
3. On the other Envelopes, Supplies, Lables, Fasteners and Tables make close to zero margin to losses. These are products that Super Store can consider dropping from the product catalogue or increase the sale price and profit margin or bargain for a lower price from the supplier.

### C) Top Selling Sub-Category

Here, we can deduce that
1. Super Store should ensure inventory are always well-stocked for the top selling sub-category such as Binders, Storage, Art and Paper.
2. On the other hand, Tables makes the least profit as well as sell the least i.e. only 3k

### D) Most Profitable Customer Segment

Consumer segment is most profitable, followed by Corporate Segment and Home Office. Hence, marketing strategy has to target or place more focus on retaining Consumer and Corporate Segment customers.

### E) Preferred Ship Mode

By a landslide, Standard Class is the preferred method of shipment and perhaps the cheapest one too. The other modes are not popular among the customers and may be too costly.

### F) Most Profitable Region

1. The most profitable region is western Europe 
2. On the other hand, the least profitable region is Central Asia, Western Africa and Western Asia.

## CONCLUSION

1. In case of Category, Technology is leading in terms of sales and profit. Sub-category such as Phones and Copies as they are highest selling and most profitable. Bundle them with the less profitable products such as Envelopes, Supplies, Lables, Fasteners and Tables to offset the losses.
2. Selling Machines and Tables result in huge losses, so Super Store has to consider to bundle them together with High Selling or Profitable sub-category such as Binders, Storage, Art and Paper products.
3. For Home Offices customers, these people might be busy with work and less likely to spend time selecting individual products, so create a Home Office package with products used for offices such as table, chairs, phone, copiers, storage, label, fasteners, bookcases.
4. For loss-making products like Envelopes, Supplies, Lables, Fasteners and Tables consider to either drop these from the catalogue or change suppliers and bargain for cheaper price.
5. Consumer and Corporate Segment make up more than 70% of customerbase. Target them by introducing special promotions and bundles for mass Consumer and Home Offices and send promotional emails.
